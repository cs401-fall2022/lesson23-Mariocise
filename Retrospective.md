- Were there any parts of this lab that were unclear or poorly specified? 
- Were you able to get the entire project done?

For the **Known issues or Bugs** section you need to detail any issues or bugs that you have in your
code. For example maybe your code crashes randomly and you couldn't figure out why. If your code
doesn't have any issues you can simply write NONE in this section.

For the **Sources used** section you must detail any sources you used outside of the textbook or
course website. If you write NONE in this section it is assumed that you didn't use google at all.
Be safe CITE!

## Experience

The most difficult part of this lab was figuring out how to use SQLite properly with node.js.
I didn't get very far with the database stuff in Lab 10, so that left a lot of learning to do 
for this lab.

## Known issues or Bugs

NONE
